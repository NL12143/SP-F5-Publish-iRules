## The BIG-IP platform runs the network. What runs the BIG-IP platform?

Underlying all BIG-IP hardware and software is F5’s proprietary operating system, TMOS, which provides unified intelligence, flexibility, and programmability.
With its application control plane architecture, TMOS gives you control over the acceleration, security, and availability services your applications require.
TMOS establishes a virtual, unified pool of highly scalable, resilient, and reusable services that can dynamically adapt to the changing conditions in data centers and virtual and cloud infrastructures.


## Take advantage of TMOS’s open API.

F5 products built on TMOS offer flexibility via an open API.

Applications can cue TMOS-based devices to control traffic flow and maximize performance using the iControl API.
You gain granular control over traffic going through F5 devices using **iRules**, F5’s scripting language.
**iApps** templates let you deploy and manage network services for specific applications.
