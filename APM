When publishing SharePoint via F5. 
In case your security policy soes not allow for a first anonymous request to SharePoint.   
You must add an iRule that simulates the SharePoint response when user is stil unauthenticated. 
It will redirect user to an federation provider (FP), and from there to his identity provider (IP). 

Request= https://extranet.contoso.com 

Response=  






For this one can use following iRule. 

when HTTP_REQUEST {
                set host [HTTP::host]
                set URL "https://$host"
                set wa "wa=wsignin1.0"
                set wtrealm "wtrealm=urn:$host"
                set wctx "wctx=[URI::encode $URL[HTTP::uri]]"
                set whr "whr=https://adfs.contoso.be/idp"
                set wreply "wreply=[URI::encode $URL/_trust/]"
                set adfs "https://adfs.contoso.be/adfs/ls/"
                set logout "https://adfs.contoso.be/LogOut"

                set trust [URI::query [HTTP::uri] trust]
                if { $trust != "" } {
                  set trust "trust=$trust" 
                } 
                else {
                  set trust "trust=default"
                }

                #when user get the website we redirect him to the ADFS if the session doesn't exist already
                if { [ HTTP::method] eq "GET" && not[ACCESS::session exists [ACCESS::session sid]]}{
                                set adfs_redirect "$adfs?$trust&$wa&$wtrealm&$wctx&$whr&$wreply"
                                #Redirect

                                HTTP::redirect $adfs_redirect
                }

    #when the user logs out we clear the session and redirect him to a specific logout page
